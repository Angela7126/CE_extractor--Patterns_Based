# Explaining contents of Each File in ./PK

Each .pk file is a data file stored by pickle package.

```python
import pickle
import codecs   # codecs is a package to change the encoding way of a file.

fpath = ur"./"  # The file path where you want to store or reload your data.
# ---- Store data ----
fp = codecs.open(fpath, 'wb', 'utf8')
pickle.dump(result, fp)
fp.close()
# ---- Load data ----
fp = open(fpath, 'rb')
result = pickle.load(fp)
fp.close()
```
