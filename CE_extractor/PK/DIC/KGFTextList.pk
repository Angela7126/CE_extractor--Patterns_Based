VWith rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace
p5
aVautomatic summarization becomes more and more desirable.
p6
aVTraditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding.
p7
aVText summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary.
p8
aVsince  people  can  more  and more easily and freely publish writings.
p9
aVThe  development  of  cyberspace  accelerates  the  expansion  of  texts
p10
aVbecause life is short while new texts are continually generated
p11
aVEfficiently finding necessary contents in the ocean of texts is very important
p12
aVWith the development of sciences, researchers are limited in time and energy to read more and more publications.
p13
aVResearchers have to focus on the literature within recent years.

aVResearchers have to focus on the literature within recent years.
p15
aVThis has led to more and more reinventions.

aV(1) single text [Luhn et al., 1958], (2) multiple texts [McKeown, 1995] [Radev, et al., 1998, 2002] [Nanba et al., 1999] [Agarwal et al., 2011], and (3) hybrid, which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them
p17
aVso that readers can know more relevant  contents.
p18
aVbecause it can extract different facets in large text(s) to enable users to read only the interested facet [Xu and Zhuge, 2012].
p19
aVThe faceted navigation approach is not traditional text summarization, but it is a special summarization
p20
aVAn explanation is that humans have commonsense on representation 'a novel tells a story' and representation 'story'.
p21
aVWhy can human use words beyond text?
p22
aVScientists summarize their ideas as abstracts placed before the main texts in papers
p23
aVso that readers can quickly know the main idea before reading the main text.
p24
aVbecause of the nature of language use and understanding.
p25
aVA text can be understood from different aspects
p26

p27
aVAny method is limited
p28
aVThis paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism)
p29
aVso as to form a general summarization methodology.
p30
aVAs a kind of language representation
p31
aVsummarization should be based on the basic principles of language use
p32
aV(3) Representation and its summarization are separated.
p33
aVThis leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.
p34
aVSeparation Principle.
p35
aVThe following three kinds of separations are involved in language:
p36
aV(1) Structure (grammar) and semantics are separated.
p37
aVSemantics cannot be directly derived from structure.
p38
aVActually, people do not rely on grammar to communicate with each other in daily life.
p39
aV(2) Knowledge for representation (e.g., grammars and idioms) and knowledge to be represented (e.g., scientific knowledge) are separated.
p40
aV(3) Representation and its summarization are separated.
p41
aVThis leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.
p42
aVThe above separation principles lead to the natural obstacle of summarization.
p43
aVThe basic characteristics of language use and understanding
p44
aV(1) Human minds cannot directly access each other.
p45
aV(2) Humans create and use languages to realize interaction between minds.
p46
aV(3) Knowledge in minds evolves and self-organizes through language use.
p47
aV(4) The use of language relies on knowledge.
p48
aV(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.

aVThe problem of designing a suitable summarizer can be transformed into the problem of searching a suitable summarizer in cyberspace.
p60
aVThe following are principles of selecting a suitable summarizer.
p61
aVSocial Selection Principle.
p62
aVThe suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.
p63
aVKnowledge selection is a kind of social selection.
p64
aVKnowledge Selection Principle.
p65
aVThe person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.
p66
aVThe above principle means that even people sharing the represented knowledge may not be the suitable person for summarizing the representation because they may not have the knowledge of representation.
p67
aVA friend of author may not be the suitable summarizer.
p68
aVThe suitable person should have similar experience with the author (including education, work, etc.) through which knowledge is learned and shared.
p69
aVThe following lemmas can be derived from the knowledge selection principle:
p70
aVSuitable Summarizer.
p71
aV(1) Authors who commonly cited a representation are the candidates of suitable summarizers.
p72
aVThis is because the represented knowledge was shared and the knowledge for representation is at the same level.
p73
aV(2) Authors are the best persons to summarize their own representations.
p74
aVThis is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.
p75
aVHowever, authors have limited time and may be influenced by individual characteristics (e.g., health and mood, and worldview) and social characteristics (e.g., culture, economy and influence).
p76
aVThe evaluation of summarization follows some principles.
p77
aVRelativity Principle.
p78
aVSatisfactory of summary is relative.
p79
aVA summary that satisfies one person may not satisfy the other.
p80

p88
aVThe satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.
p89
aVThis is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.
p90
aVOpenness Principle.
p91
aVA satisfied summary can be reached only through an open social process of interactions and representations.
p92
aVThe openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary, and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary.

p181
aVThe above fundamental characteristics and principles indicate the following strategies for summarization.
p182
aVSummarization strategies.
p183
aV(1) Making use of the summaries of the persons who have rich social relations with the original authors.
p184
aVMore types of links render more common knowledge and experience [Zhuge, 2009].
p185
aVThis is because the establishment of rich social relations indicates common individual characteristics and social characteristics.
p186
aV(2) Adapting to readers' interests.
p187
aVThe interests of readers determine the selection of summaries.
p188
aVA good summarizer should know its potential readers.
p189
aVThis requests a summarizer to collect and analyze readers' interests according to their reading behaviors and attitudes to summaries.
p190
aVThis is to pursuit a suitable summary rather than the best summary.
p191
aV(3) Making summarization through human-machine interaction, which can make full use of the advantages of both human and machines.
p192
aVIt is the right way to pursue a satisfied summarization through a human-machine symbiotic system [Licklider, 1960].
p193
aV(4) Enabling different summaries to cooperate and compete with each other for impact at multiple dimensions (e.g., acceptance for reading and adoption for generating new summaries).
p194
aVRanking reviews to encourage contribution and competition among reviews reflect social value in a summarization environment.
p195
aVDifferent summaries may represent different characteristics of the summarizer.
p196
aVIntegrating individuals of diverse characteristics can cooperate with each other in making new summaries.
p197
aV(5) Transforming summarizations into the problem of searching suitable persons or summaries in the social networks of authors, readers, summarizers, representations and links.
p198
aV(6) Enabling summarizers to know the background of representations, including technological, social and economic aspects.
p199
aVThis is because the establishment of rich social relations indicates common individual characteristics and social characteristics.
p200
aV(1) Making use of the summaries of the persons who have rich social relations with the original authors.
p201
aVMore types of links render more common knowledge and experience [Zhuge, 2009].
p202
aV(2) Adapting to readers' interests.
p203
aVThe interests of readers determine the selection of summaries.
p204
aVA good summarizer should know its potential readers.
p205
aVThis requests a summarizer to collect and analyze readers' interests according to their reading behaviors and attitudes to summaries.
p206
aVThis is to pursuit a suitable summary rather than the best summary.
p207
aVCitation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.
p208
aVTherefore, it is necessary to understand citation when studying summarization.
p209
aVDifferent from scientific papers, webpages can be changed, and links can be also changed
p210
aV so the hyperlink network of webpages evolve notably.
p211
aVSome implicit citations have mark words such as "someone says" and according to "someone's opinion".
p212
aVThese implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.
p213
aVSome implicit citations just reuse others' sentences or clauses without any mark word.
p214
aVFor example, the sentence "It's Greek to me!
p215
aVappeared in text implicitly cite the scenario used in 1599 in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, and "into thin air" cites the book written by Jon Krakauer published in 1997 and many other earlier works.
p216
aVIf representation A cites a set of representations B
p217
aVthen B constitutes an extension of A.
p218
aVIf representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C,
p219
aVthen both B and C constitute the extension of A.
p220
aVIn scientific papers, the core representations usually appear in the front and in the end (e.g., title, abstract and conclusion)
p221
aVso that readers can be impressed before and after reading the main body.
p222
aVHumans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times, so we have the following axiom.
p223
aVAxiom (Additive Axiom).
p224
aVA representation can be composed by a set of representations.
p225
aVAxiom (Additive Axiom).
p226
aVA representation can be composed by a set of representations.
p227
aVTherefore, a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations:
p228
aVp = p(p) |
p229
aVp U ...
p230
aVU p |
p231
aV{p, ..., p}, which represents a recursive structure of an abstraction p(p), an union p U ...
p232
aVU p, and a set of representations {p, ..., p}.
p233
aVDictionaries explain words in texts,
p234
aVso  they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts.
p235
aVFrom this point of view, any text has a set of basic citations.
p236
aVSo, the above statement is suitable for text.
p237
aVStructuring summary in an appropriate form is important
p238
aVas summary is mainly for human to read and understand.
p239
aVThe original structure of the core representations takes the priority to appear in summary.
p240
aVThe reason is that authors are the best person to organize his representation.
p241
aVTo reflect not only reading characteristics but also understanding characteristics
p242
aVit is a reasonable method to combine the linear organization with the order of generalization and specialization.
p243
aVHumans experience in a multi-dimensional space but have to use a two-dimensional media such as paper and screen to externalize representation.
p244
aVInformation loses through transformation from the internal representation to the form of display.
p245
aVInventing a new interface that can easily convey representations through multiple channels is a way to improve human understanding.
p246
aVSummarization carries out in an interaction environment where people read, write, cite and communicate with personal spaces.
p247
aVThe personal spaces reflect personal reading experience, interests and knowledge based on the texts that have been read.
p248
aVA summarization can be satisfied only when it matches the personal space of the reader.
p249
aVas researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.
p250
aVPrevious research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary
p251
aVOptimizing the layout of display needs to consider three dimensions.
p252
aV3D printer extends display from cyberspace to the physical space.
p253
aVNew interface devices like 3D monitor will significantly influence the representation of summary.
p254
aVSummarization is involved in individual and social construction processes
p255
aVso it concerns multiple dimensions.
p256
aVThe basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding
p257
aV indicate the following dimensions for evaluating a summarization
p258
aVA summary should match the reader's cognitive level.
p259
aVTherefore, concepts at the reader's cognitive level should be selected.
p260
aVif it knows more about the author, including the relevant articles and social networks.
p261
aVA summarizer can understand the input representation better
p262
aVbecause some representations are unnecessary for summarization
p263
aVInput should also be evaluated
p264
aVas they can be quickly understood.
p265
aVOn one hand, a very simple and short representation such as a short paragraph of text and a picture is unnecessary for summarization
p266
aVbecause only the persons sharing knowledge with the writer can make satisfied summarization.
p267
aVThe closed systems designed by particular persons are unable to make satisfied summarization
p268
aVso that it can select the appropriate representations (e.g., sentences) and use the representations that the reader is familiar with.
p269
aVThis also implies that a summarizer should be able to interact with readers
p270
aVsince pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.
p271
aVIt is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary
p272
aVaccording to the semantic locality principle [Zhuge, 2010].
p273
aVThere could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected according to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences
p274
aVA picture can convey meaning in about 1-10 seconds due to its familiarity and complexity to the viewer.
p275
aVIn contrast, readers need to scan the whole text to know the text-only summary.
p276
aVThe summary with pictures is more attractive than the text-only summary.
p277
aVAn explanation is that the summary with pictures gives readers stronger impression and provides more dimensions for rendering meaning, and establishes more links to render meaning.
p278
aVThe summary incorporating pictures can enhance reader's short-term and long-term memory.
p279
aVas they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.
p280
aVHumans are specialized in recognizing pictures
p281
aVThe semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage
p282
aVand thus provide the ground for selection.
p283
aVThe semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.
p284
aVThe Web 2.0 provides the platform for people to upload and tag pictures on the Web.
p285
aVd) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions
p286
aVso that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.
p287
aVAs new pictures are continually added to the online systems
p288
aVa good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.
p289
aVThe core words such as "CIKM2012", "hotel", "golf" and "garden" can be identified by comparing the source text and tags.
p290
aVThen, the relations like "back of" relying on the core words can be identified.
p291
aVSo, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].
p292
aVas the tag sets of different pictures may be overlapped.
p293
aVThe generated summary is not unique
p294
aVExisting summaries can be put into the space and linked to the tag set.
p295
aVIn this way, the existing summaries can be reused when making new summarizations.
p296
aVAccording to the efficiency principle and regional principle,
p297
aVthe radius of the network should be small.
p298
aVIt is important in video management, retrieval and browsing.
p299
aVIt becomes more and more important with wide use of digital cameras in our society for security, news, entertainment, education, advertisements, etc.
p300
aVHumans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements, but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday.
p301
aVAutomatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.
p302
aVto get semantically meaningful summaries of complicated video contents
p303
aVThe patterns of events, conversations, and behaviors should be characterized
p304
aVFor particular applications like football games [Ekin, 2003], important sections such as slow-motion segments and goals in game are known by humans
p305
aVso it is easy to find the important sections.
p306
aVCurrent online movies contain subtitles,
p307
aVwhich provide a new condition for making summarization of videos through natural language processing.
p308
aVas it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].
p309
aVSummarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management
p310
aVIn some areas like CAD, graph components have formal specifications.
p311
aVMaking abstraction on graph components can be done through mathematical derivation.
p312
aVSo, summarization in these areas has the reasons of summarization and the correctness guarantee of using summaries.
p313
aVdue to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones
p314
aVthe explosion of digital pictures online in recently years
p315
aVwith the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years
p316
aVThere have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures
p317
aVbecause they have experience and knowledge out of pictures.
p318
aVHumans can make a humanized summarization
p319
aVbecause the semantic links between pictures may be poor.
p320
aVThe key problem is to select a better picture from the candidates that have the same projections on the dimensions of time, location and topic,
p321
aVModern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information,
p322
aVso the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions: language, feature, time and location.
p323
aVThe form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.
p324
aVHumans have been pursuing the ways to represent thoughts, behaviors, artifacts and the nature.
p325
aVVarious devices and approaches have been invented and developed to represent and process different forms such as natural languages, pictures, videos and graphs.
p326
aVVarious representations constitute a representation space with particular structure and operations.
p327
aVA distinguished characteristic is that humans generate behaviors (including mental behaviors) different from the input.
p328
aVThis indicates that human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level.
p329
aVThis indicates that human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level.
p330
aVThis indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts, pictures, videos and graphs.

VSummarization is an open representation of representation, in diverse forms, from multiple dimensions, and through interactions in multiple spaces.
p544
aVThe basic interactions include selecting, citing and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.
p545
aVTexts have been the major means to reflect the evolution of human society.
p546
aVIt is necessary to explore automatic summarization of texts expanding rapidly in cyberspace.
p547
aVHowever, existing approaches are empirical, mainly relying on statistics, structure and linguistic analysis while neglecting the nature of representation and understanding.
p548
aVThis paper summarizes previous approaches and explores the fundamental theory and method for summarization from multiple dimensions.
p549
aVThe core viewpoint is that summarization is carried out with various interactions involved in human, machine, and various representations including text, picture, and video.
p550
aVWriters and readers represent mainly through explicit or implicit citations.
p551
aVStudying the summarization of pictures, videos and graphs reaches a general summarization method.
p552
aVIt is hard for automatic summarization systems to realize human-level summarization as it concerns the essential natural and social differences between human and the systems.
p553
aVPutting summarization into a human-machine-nature symbiotic network is a way to make a breakthrough.
p554
aVA significant progress of summarization research relies on an innovative summarization of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, physics, computer science, and artificial intelligence from multiple dimensions.

VSummarization is one of the key features of human intelligence.
p561
aVIt plays an important role in understanding and representation.
p562
aVWith rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable.
p563
aVText summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary.
p564
aVTraditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding.
p565
aVThis paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.
p566
aVInvestigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework.
p567
aVFurther, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space.
p568
aVThe basic viewpoints include:
p569
aV(1) a representation suitable for summarization should have a core, indicated by its intention and extension;
p570
aV(2) summarization is an open process of various interactions, involved in various explicit and implicit citations;

aVUsers can define SLN instances
p742
aVAn important issue is how to automatically generate a schema from a set of SLN instances.
p743
aVThis concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.
p744
aVbecause the clusters and links may need adapting when new instances are continuously generated.

p776
aVFor example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.
p777
aVThis concerns the classification on students' behaviors (including micro expressions) and carrying out real-time analysis and adaptation.
p778
aVSensors are limited in ability to collect all information in the physical space,
p779
aVso users still need to directly collect the significant information in the physical space and then put them into the cyber space after analysis (including experiment).
p780
aVBased on above discussion,
p781
aVthe following question naturally emerges: Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?
p782
aVBrain nets navigate with a kind of triangle-based grid cells [18], while humans often use distance space (e.g., using orthogonal latitude and longitude to locate surface objects on map) to locate objects in the physical space.
p783
aVIn the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.
p784
aVCoincidently, the Semantic Link Network reasons through triangle links [86].
p785
aVCP3SME will coordinate triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating and zooming.
p786
aVby establishing and evolving cyber semantic images for various behaviors in multiple spaces, for example, by tracing language using, interactions, and the change of various patterns during behaving.

aVTime dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.
p791
aVTime compression accelerates evolution and enables interaction to pass through times.
p792
aVEvolution simulation can be slowed down by stretching time, which enables the details of evolution to be clearly observed.
p793
aVThis requires CP3SME to have an elastic time dimension and the models for the evolution of communities and individuals.
p794
aVScientists will be able to access research objects and thoughts as well as their formation processes on demand through times.
p795
aVThis means that they can not only communicate with peers but also access important thoughts through time.
p796
aVThey can not only use languages to express ideas but also link the language representations to reasons in multiple spaces, to relevant research, and to applications.
p797
aVThis requires a new form of publication that uses complex links.
p798
aVThe statuses of artifacts (e.g., bridges) can be monitored in lifetime
p799
aVso that necessary maintenance can be carried out on time to ensure healthy status.

aVas the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution
p806
aVHealth of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be linked to measures.
p807
aVSociety will be safer and life quality will be higher

aVas little semantics and culture are concerned.
p809
aVThey are limited in ability to support effective intercultural collaboration

aVThe CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively
p812
aVAs the consequence of collaboration,
p813
aVthe collaborators' mental spaces evolve toward more commonalities.
p814
aVAs the consequence of collaboration, the collaborators' mental spaces evolve toward more commonalities.
p815
aVThis may lead to breakthrough in natural language processing.

p817
aVThe CP3SME will be efficient and low carbon

aVThe Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space
p821
aVso that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].
p822
aVBased on individual interactive semantic base,
p823
aVindividual mental spaces can also self-organize into communities through multiple interaction channels.
p824
aVIf the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links,
p825
aVan individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.
p826
aVIf artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links,
p827
aVthe artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.
p828
aVIf socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links,
p829
aVthe socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.
p830
aVdue to the limitation of lifetime and unlimited expansion of documents.
p831
aVIndividuals can only know a small part of the space and will know relatively less
p832
aVIf symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links,
p833
aVthe symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.
p834
aVIf information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links,

p842
aVdue to the differences between individuals.
p843
aVSome communities have long life while others have only short life
p844
aVThe difference of experiences
p845
aVmay lead to the differences in using languages.
p846
aVdue to energy limitation and privacy.
p847
aVFirstly, individuals can only know a small part of the large-scale networks
p848
aVSecondly, to minimize energy,
p849
aVbehaviors need to be localized.
p850
aVThirdly, individuals of the same class should be organized in nearby locations
p851
aVso that they can be assessed at the same time.
p852
aVdue to the long-term movement of the network (e.g., continuous evolution, complex reasoning, and information flow cycle).
p853
aVAny behavior may influence the whole community or the whole network
p854
aVby recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].
p855
aVAs a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces
p856
aVThe socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.
p857
aVThis enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.
p858
aVthrough reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.

p861
aVTime, place, event, and individual will be linked
p862
aVDifferent spaces have different types of distance, for example, friendship between individuals, the difference between interests, and the distance between offices.
p863
aVReflecting different aspects of the objects needs to use the distances in different spaces.
p864
aVVarious sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space
p865
aVso that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.
p866
aVsince classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.
p867
aVDifferent from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89],
p868
aVby integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.
p869
aVThe mental space can be modeled
p870
aVfor generating and operating flows through semantic links.
p871
aVPoints can cooperate with each other for rendering and remembering semantic images as well as
p872
aVbecause semantic images in the author's mind keep evolving with experience.
p873
aVEven for the author, different semantic images may emerge when sensing his/her artifact at different times,
p874
aVAsking a group of students to draw paintings independently according to the same story,
p875
aVthe paintings drawn by different students are different.
p876
aVThis is because the semantic images in their minds are different.

aVAsking a group of students to draw paintings independently according to the same story, the paintings drawn by different students are different.
p878
aVif it inputs the same thing.
p879
aVIn contrast, any machine will output the same thing
p880
aVFor example, co-location is a socio rule for linking related services in physically nearby locations.
p881
aVKnowing this rule enables navigation systems to raise efficiency.
p882
aVby incorporating the class mechanisms of the object-oriented method [6][39][61].
p883
aVIt can be specialized for dynamic or functional modeling
p884
aVby making use of OOMD, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), in the background of interactions between multiple spaces.
p885
aV8 depicts the way to enrich SLN for detailed function modeling
p886
aVbased on SOA to meet the requirements.
p887
aVSocio requirements trigger self-organization of services
p888
aVby composing the classes defined in OOMD.
p889
aVThe basic services can be implemented
p890
aVRegarding semantic nodes of SLN as agents,
p891
aVmulti-agent (MA) techniques can be adopted to enhance SLN [72].
p892
aVRegarding class or object as node,
p893
aVthe object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, method, roles, and functional modeling in OOMD support the specialization of SLN.
p894
aVby regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.
p895
aVThe characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA
p896
aVby integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].
p897
aVAll possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled
p898
aVaccording to the emerging principles and the class of the high-level community that includes it [87].

aVsocio classification and regulation on attributes, objects, classes, relations, behaviors and rules.
p905
aVCommonsense of a community is the result of
p906
aVVersatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.
p907
aVThis leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.
p908
aVsince different semantic nodes and links play different roles.
p909
aVAdding semantic nodes or links to SLN or removing them from SLN may have different influence on the network
p910
aVdue to the diversity of semantic links and rules.
p911
aVReasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems
p912
aVbecause it is not necessary to derive out all relations to overload storage.
p913
aVReasoning can carry out locally
p914
aVaccording to the known situation such as the neighbor semantic links and relevant rules.
p915
aVA semantic node can participate in reasoning when necessary
p916
aVReasoning
p917
aVleads to the dependence between semantic links and the dependence between operations.
p918
aVif different orders of operations are applied to an SLN [74].
p919
aVThe result of operation may be different
p920
aVbecause adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.
p921
aVAn SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link
p922
aVSemantic nodes can include rich contents
p923
aVso that an SLN is not only for machines to process but also for humans to operate, emerge semantic images and reasoning.
p924
aVThe above discussion
p925
aVshows that SLN is different from previous links and graph-based models in goal, model, method and research issues.
p926
aVby designing the functions of artifacts, assigning semantic indicators to artifacts to reflect meaning or idea, and linking one another by direct or indirect referencing (e.g., paintings of the same author or times).
p927
aVHumans create the artifact space
p928
aVby adding or removing a semantic link, as depicted in Fig.10 (e).
p929
aVIt also enables humans to observe the influence
p930
aVbecause A3 can get information about A1 when it interacts with A2.
p931
aVinteraction between A1 and A3, and interaction between A3 and A2 can also evolve the relation between A1 and A2,
p932
aVaccording to their respective characteristics.
p933
aVDifferent spaces can answer and explain what, where, who, why, when, and how
p934
aVbased on the modeling of mental space and the translation between languages under different cultures.
p935
aVIt can extract the SLNs from interactions, and make necessary abstraction and evolution during interaction
p936
aVFig.12 compares the hyperlink, the semantic link, and the complex link.
p937
aVThe hyperlink enables any web page to connect to any other page.
p938
aVThe semantic link connects semantic nodes with certain rules on relations.
p939
aVDifferent orders of operations may lead to different effects.
p940
aVThe complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.
p941
aVThey will influence the evolution of the network.
p942
aVTherefore, communities of different types will emerge and evolve according to different rules.
p943
aVThe difference and competition among individuals
p944
aVleads to the formation of various network characteristics like the centrality [91].
p945
aVas helpful interaction can help relieve mental pressure and raise immunity [38].
p946
aVPeople who are good at communication can live longer than those with little socio interaction
p947
aVPeople who are good at communication can live longer than those with little socio interaction as helpful interaction can help relieve mental pressure and raise immunity [38].
p948
aVTherefore, the spouse relation is transformed into the divorce relation.
p949
aVdue to its centrality in complex link network and interaction.
p950
aVAn individual x in society has potential energy Ep(x)
p951
aVThe node with richer types of links takes the higher priority to emerge than that with less or single type of links.
p952
aVThis is because the node with richer types of links offers higher probability to the new link to derive out more links so that communities have higher probability to be enriched or changed.
p953
aVThis is because the node with richer types of links offers higher probability to the new link to derive out more links
p954
aVso that communities have higher probability to be enriched or changed.
p955
aVby using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.
p956
aV(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space
p957
aV(3) The cyber-physical-socio effects of various behaviors are available
p958
aVso that appropriate decisions can be made to ensure harmonious development of various spaces.
p959
aVas it will emerge and evolve new semantic images when reflecting multiple spaces simultaneously.
p960
aV(4) The mental space will develop new functions
p961
aV(5) Complex linking different spaces
p962
aVenables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.
p963
aVFor example, linking the agricultural ecological system to the industrial ecological system
p964
aVenables some waste of industry to be used as the fertilizer of crops, and enables the agricultural products to be the raw materials of some industries.
p965
aVHumans can not only sense from multiple channels but also form close loops through sensing, behaving, emerging semantic images, and reasoning.
p966
aVBehaving through one type of channel (e.g., writing) accompanies sensing through another type of channel (e.g., vision).
p967
aVPractice (e.g., dictation) helps establish the links between the behaviors through different channels and between behaviors and semantic images.
p968
aVThis is why blind people cannot write in the normal natural languages.
p969
aVHumans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.
p970
aVA prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.
p971
aVThe final design can lead to the artifacts in the artifact space through a manufacture process.
p972
aVThis indicates a new design paradigm that enables designers and users to co-experience during the whole design process.
p973
aVsince interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.
p974
aVIt is important for ensuring effective interaction
p975
aV(5) The cyber space builds cyber semantic images during direct and indirect interactions
p976
aVso that it knows the past and present interactions.

aVas its computing components and computing process is pre-defined and fixed, which cannot be changed by input and output.
p978
aVTuring machine is a closed system
p979
aVsince machines may be linked to existing machines from time to time or disconnected the current links according to the real-time requirement and rules in multiple spaces.
p980
aVThe CP3SME is an open system
p981
aVAn idea will be linked to sketch, to design, to the production processes, and further to the closed loops in the environment.
p982
aVThis concerns the modelling of the spaces, the mapping between spaces, the mechanism of influence, and the rules of linking and flows through links.
p983
aVas he thought that unnatural act will break natural balance.
p984
aVLaozi respected the nature rather than action
p985
aVby collecting multiple definitions.
p986
aVVarious encyclopedias are to establish consensus
p987
aVdue to culture difference.
p988
aVthe first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language
p989
aVPsychological research indicates that brain uses different regions to process the first language and non first languages.
p990
aVThe epistemology has been emphasized in the effort to solve the semantics problem [77].
p991
aVThis implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.
p992
aVas the world people live and the way people interact with each other have been changed greatly with the generation and evolution of various spaces.
p993
aVNew philosophical issues will arise in CP3SME research
p994
aVNew philosophical issues will arise in CP3SME research as the world people live and the way people interact with each other have been changed greatly with the generation and evolution of various spaces.
p995
aVThe scientific pursuit of the CP3SME brings challenging philosophical issues.
p996
aVsince the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.
p997
aVOnly the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics
p998
aVThe generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.
p999
aVSo, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.
p1000
aVbecause they have different experience.
p1001
aVDifferent semantic images may emerge when a form is sensed by different individuals

p1004
aVA little interaction helps a lot in understanding since interactions enable individuals to co-experience in multiple spaces.

aVThe CP3SME is a complex space, where diverse spaces emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other.
p1315
aVIt aims at an ideal environment for human beings to live and work, and concerns diversity, dynamicity, harmony and sustainability.
p1316
aVLinking within and through spaces, emerging semantic images, and reasoning at different levels and facets are basic motions of the environment.

aVThe following are four levels of pursuits of semantic linking.
p1318
aV(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms such as relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.
p1319
aV(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features such as self-organized peer-to-peer linking and high-performance routing, semantic communities and emerging principles, pervasive and effect-aware linking, and link recommendation.
p1320
aV(3) Realizing semantic lens by integrating with the multi-dimensional classification space [89].
p1321
aV(4) Exploring the general linking methodology.
p1322
aVThis concerns new philosophical thinking, interactive computing model, nature of the complex linking such as dynamicity, symmetry and rules of various flows, the methods for improving various closed loops, and the methods for coordinating spaces, controlling and predicting evolution.
p1323
aVMachine intelligence, human intelligence, and socio intelligence are extended in the complex space by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.
p1324
aVThe methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation.

p1336
aVThe following are fundamental limitations of machine intelligence:
p1337
aV(1) machines know little link and rules in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover laws and solve problems in these spaces;

aVand, (2) machines can only process pre-designed algorithms and data structures in the cyber space.
p1339
aVThey are limited in ability to go beyond the cyber space, to learn linking rules, to know the effect of linking, and to explain computing results according to physical, physiological, psychological and socio laws.
p1340
aVLinking various spaces will create a complex space -- the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-SocioMental Environment CP3SME.
p1341
aVDiverse spaces will emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence.
p1342
aVFrom multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyberphysical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence.

aVHence the machine calculates the numbers fmk(n) in some order where fmk(n) is fm(n) if the computation of fm(n) ends after k steps and is otherwise undefined.
p1372
aVbecause this procedure is extremely inefficient.
p1373
aVOur problem does not end once we have found this procedure for computing g(m,r)
p1374
aVIn order to do better than such a purely enumerative method,
p1375
aVit is necessary to use methods which take into account some of the structure of Turing machines.
p1376
aVsince for any Turing machine there is another one which does k steps of the original machine in one step.
p1377
aVthis won't do
p1378
aVby increasing the number of internal states, though this is not so easy to show.
p1379
aVIt is probably also possible to increase the speed
p1380
aVThe most obvious idea is to say that if T1 and T2 are two Turing machines each computing a g(m,r), then for a particular m and r the more efficient one is the one which carries out the computation in the fewest steps.
p1381
aVHowever, this won't do since for any Turing machine there is another one which does k steps of the original machine in one step.
p1382
aVHowever, the new machine has many more different kinds of symbol than the old.
p1383
aVIt is probably also possible to increase the speed by increasing the number of internal states, though this is not so easy to show.
p1384
aV(Shannon shows elsewhere in these studies that it is possible to reduce the number of internal states to two at the cost of increasing the number of symbols and reducing the speed.
p1385
aVHence we offer the following revised definition of the length of a computation performed by a Turing machine.
p1386
aVFor any universal Turing machine there is a standard way of recoding on it the computation performed by the given machine.
p1387
aVLet this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.
p1388
aVThere are certain difficulties here connected with the fact that the rate of computation is limited if the tape of the universal machine is finite dimensional, and hence the rate should probably be defined with respect to a machine whose tape is infinite dimensional but each square of which has at most two states and which has only two internal states.
p1389
aVThis requires a mild generalization of the concept of Turing machines.
p1390
aVif the tape of the universal machine is finite dimensional
p1391
aVthe rate of computation is limited
p1392
aVIt will be made at least plausible that a machine with Q internal states and S symbols should be considered as making about (1/2)log(QS) elementary steps per step of computation
p1393
aVand hence the number of steps in a computation should be multiplied by this f
p1394
aVif L(m,r,T1) \u2264 L(m,r,T2) for all m and r for which these numbers are finite,
p1395
aVwe should certainly say that T1 is more efficient than T2.
p1396
aVby adding to it facilities for testing a conclusion and having it spend a small fraction of its time trying the integers in order
p1397
aVAny machine can be modified into such a machine
p1398
aVThe idea of assigning a weight function p(m,r) and then calculating SUM_(m,r)(p(m,r)L(m,r,T)) does not work very well because L(m,r,T) is not bounded by any recursive function of m and r.
p1399
aVHowever, it is not so easy to give a function which gives an over-all estimate of the efficiency of a machine at computing g(m,r).
p1400
aVbecause L(m,r,T) is not bounded by any recursive function of m and r.
p1401
aVThe idea of assigning a weight function p(m,r) and then calculating SUM_(m,r)(p(m,r)L(m,r,T)) does not work very well
p1402
aVbecause there are rather simple machines whose only procedure is to guess a constant which are fast when g(m,r) happens to equal that constant.
p1403
aVThere cannot be any machine which is as fast as any other machine on any problem
p1404
aVThis is known to be a hopeless task.
p1405
aVSystems much simpler than Turing machine theory have been shown to have unsolvable decision procedures.
p1406
aVSo, we look for a way of evading these difficulties.
p1407
aVSystems much simpler than Turing machine theory have been shown to have unsolvable decision procedures.
p1408
aVThis is known to be a hopeless task.
p1409
aVThis is based on the plausible idea that, in searching for the solution to a problem, the given data should be taken into account.
p1410
aVOur procedure consists in trying the numbers fk(m,r) in order (again diagonalizing to avoid computations which don't end.
p1411
aVThis is based on the idea that the best procedure is more likely to be recursively simple, rather than merely to have a low number in the ordering.
p1412
aVThe next complication which suggests itself is to revise the order in which recursive functions are considered.
p1413
aVOne way is to consider f_(fk(L))(m,r) diagonalized on k and L.
p1414
aVby going through the enumeration.
p1415
aVOf course, exhaustiveness in examining for usefulness can be attained for any effectively enumerable class of objects simply
p1416
aVIn order to get around the fact that all formal systems which are anywhere near adequate for describing recursive function theory are incomplete,
p1417
aVwe avoid restriction to any one of them by introducing the notion of a formal theory (not for the first time,
p1418
aVby introducing the notion of a formal theory (not for the first time,
p1419
aVwe avoid restriction to any one of them
p1420
aVThe reader should note that a formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.
p1421
aVThus, knowledge can be interpreted as a predisposition to act in certain ways under given conditions, and an action scheme can be interpreted as a belief that certain action is appropriate under these conditions.
p1422
aVbecause a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.
p1423
aVThis equivalence should not be made
p1424
aVif and only if its behavior can most concisely be described by statements, including those of the form "It now believes Pythagoras' theorem.
p1425
aVPerhaps, a machine should be regarded as thinking
p1426
aVIn determining a procedure which has action schemes, theories, etc., we are imposing our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine.
p1427
aVThe point is to do this so that the procedures we offer are general (will eventually solve every solvable problem) and also are improvable by the methods built into the machine.
p1428

Vbecause it doesn't yet know about the deposit I made this morning.
p1513
aVWe may say of an automatic teller machine, 'It thinks I don't have enough money in my account
p1514
aVMuch that we'll need to know concerns the information stored in computers,
p1515
aVwhich is why we find ourselves using psychological words like 'knows', 'thinks', and 'wants' in referring to machines, even though machines are very different from humans and these  words arose from the human need to talk about other humans.
p1516
aVAdopting this principle of rationality,
p1517
aVwe see that different machines have intellectual qualities to differing extents.
p1518
aVHowever, artificial intelligence is a difficult branch of science and engineering, and, judging by present slow progress,
p1519
aVit might take a long time.
p1520
aVWe have enough trouble figuring out our duties to our fellow humans and to animals without creating a bunch of robots with qualities that would allow anyone to feel sorry for them or would allow them to feel sorry for themselves.
p1521
aVPresent machines have almost no emotional qualities, and, in my opinion, it would be a bad idea to give them any.
p1522
aVSince I advocate some anthropomorphism,
p1523
aVI'd better explain what I consider good and bad anthropomorphism.
p1524
aVIt helps understand what they will do, how our actions will affect them, how to compare them with ourselves and how to design them.
p1525
aVThe reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.
p1526
aVFirst we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.
p1527
aVSecond what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.
p1528
aVResearchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.
p1529
aVbecause it knows there's no money in my account,'
p1530
aV'It won't give me any cash
p1531
aVbecause I gave it my secret number'.
p1532
aV'It knows who I am
p1533
aVbecause we're hard put to define these things.
p1534
aVIt's difficult to be rigorous about whether a machine really 'knows', 'thinks', etc.,
p1535
aVwhereby the program decides what to do.
p1536
aVThese axioms are used by reasoning programs as part of the process
p1537
aVbecause the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.
p1538
aVIn general we cannot give definitions,
p1539
aVif we can regard it as believing that it will attempt to do it.
p1540
aVWe say that a machine intends to do something
p1541
aVIf the machine may do something we don't know about but that can laterbe explained in relation to a goal,
p1542
aVwe have no choice but to use 'is trying' or some synonym to explain the behavior.
p1543
aVSome of the above attributes of human self-consciousness are easy to program.
p1544
aVFor example, it is not hard to make a program look at itself, and many AI programs do look at parts of themselves.
p1545
aVOthers are more difficult.
p1546
aVAlso animals cannot be shown to have more than a few.
p1547
aVTherefore, many present and future programs can best be described as partially self-conscious.
p1548
aVbecause there are many ways of knowing that a dog wants to go out.
p1549
aVThe statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did,
p1550
aVbecause of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.
p1551
aVIt is useful
p1552
aVIf the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors,
p1553
aVit will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.
p1554
aVit will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature,
p1555
aVmaking your bed too cold.
p1556
aVIf the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft,
p1557
aVit will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot.
p1558
aVit will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed
p1559
aVso it will be too hot.
p1560
aVbecause most people don't need the word 'think' to understand how a thermostatic control works.
p1561
aVThe example is extreme,
p1562
aVIf we had only thermostats to think about,
p1563
aVwe wouldn't bother with the concept of belief at all.
p1564
aVAnd if all we wanted to think about were zero and one,
p1565
aVwe wouldn't bother with the concept of number.
p1566
aVConfronted with an uncomfortable room you form any of the following hypotheses depending on what other information you had.
p1567
aV1) It's trying to do the right thing, but it can't because the valve is stuck.
p1568
aVBut then it should complain.
p1569
aV2) It regards Grandpa as more important than me, and it is keeping the room hot in case he comes in.
p1570
aV3) It confuses me with Grandpa.
p1571
aV4) It has forgotten what climate I like.
p1572
aVbecause the valve is stuck.
p1573
aV1) It's trying to do the right thing, but it can't
p1574
aVSearle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.
p1575
aVWe suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.
p1576
aVThis is analogous to a computer, which only obeys its programming language, but can be programmed such that one can communicate with it in a different programming language, or in English.
p1577
aVaimed at understanding a system with which one interacts.
p1578
aVDaniel Dennett, Tufts University philosopher, has proposed three attitudes
p1579
aVit shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to set it, no matter how it works.
p1580
aVThe design stance can usefully be applied to a thermostat --
p1581
aVWe say things like, 'The store's billing computer wants me to pay up,
p1582
aVso it intends to frighten me by sending me threatening letters'.
p1583
aVwhen we also understand the machine in physical terms.
p1584
aVIt is easiest to uderstand the ascription of thoughts to machines in circumstances
p1585
aVWe humans can easily fool ourselves when there is something we want to believe.
p1586
aVHowever, we must be careful not to ascribe properties to a machine that the particular machine doesn't have.
p1587
aVIf designers and programmers think about the apparent mental qualities that their programs will have,
p1588
aVthey'll create programs that are easier and pleasanter -- more humane -- to deal with.

VAn expert system is a computer program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain.
p1828
aVThe ideas behind them and several examples have been described in other lectures in this symposium.
p1829
aVTheir performance in their specialized domains are often very impressive.
p1830
aVNevertheless, hardly any of them have certain common sense knowledge and ability possessed by any non-feeble-minded human.
p1831
aVThis lack makes them "brittle".
p1832
aVBy this is meant that they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don't recognize their own limitations.
p1833
aVMany important applications will require common sense abilities.
p1834
aVThe object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.
p1835
aVCommon sense facts and methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence.
p1836
aVThis isn't exactly a new point of view.
p1837
aVI have been advocating "Computer Programs with Common Sense"since I wrote a paper with that title in 1958.
p1838
aVStudying common sense capability has sometimes been popular and sometimes unpopular among AI researchers.
p1839
aVAt present it's popular, perhaps because new AI knowledge offers new hope of progress.
p1840
aVCertainly AI researchers today know a lot more about what common sense is than I knew in 1958 -- or in 1969 when I wrote another paper on the subject.
p1841
aVHowever, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult, and the number of scientists working in the area is still far too small.
p1842
aVOne of the best known expert systems is MYCIN (Shortliffe 1976;
p1843
aVDavis, Buchanan and Shortliffe 1977), a program for advising physicians on treating bacterial infections of the blood and meningitis.
p1844
aVIt does reasonably well without common sense, provided the user has common sense and understands the program's limitations.
p1845
aVMYCIN conducts a question and answer dialog.
p1846
aVAfter asking basic facts about the patient such as name, sex and age, MYCIN asks about suspected bacterial organisms, suspected sites of infection, the presence of specific symptoms (e.g.
p1847
aVfever, headache) relevant to diagnosis, the outcome of laboratory tests, and some others.
p1848
aVIt then recommends a certain course of antibiotics.
p1849
aVWhile the dialog is in English, MYCIN avoids having to understand freely written English by controlling the dialog.
p1850
aVIt outputs sentences, but the user types only single words or standard phrases.
p1851
aVIts major innovations over many previous expert systems were that it uses measures of uncertainty (not probabilities) for its diagnoses and the fact that it is prepared to explain its reasoning to the physician, so he can decide whether to accept it.
p1852
aVOur discussion of MYCIN begins with its ontology.
p1853
aVThe ontology of a program is the set of entities that its variables range over.
p1854
aVEssentially this is what it can have information about.
p1855
aVMYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.
p1856
aVDoctors, hospitals, illness and death are absent.
p1857
aVEven patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.
p1858
aVThis is because patients aren't values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.
p1859
aVIt would therefore be difficult to modify MYCIN to learn from its experience.
p1860
aVMYCIN's program, written in a general scheme called EMYCIN, is a socalled production system.
p1861
aVA production system is a collection of rules, each of which has two parts -- a pattern part and an action part.
p1862
aVWhen a rule is activated, MYCIN tests whether the pattern part matches the database.
p1863
aVIf so this results in the variables in the pattern being matched to whatever entities are required for the match of the database.
p1864
aVIf not the pattern fails and MYCIN tries another.
p1865
aVIf the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.
p1866
aVThe whole process of questioning and recommending is built up out of productions.
p1867
aVThe production formalism turned out to be suitable for representing a large amount of information about the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.
p1868
aVWhen MYCIN is used in its intended manner it scores better than medical students or interns or practicing physicians and on a par with experts in bacterial diseases when the latter are asked to perform in the same way.
p1869
aVHowever, MYCIN has not been put into production use, and the reasons given by experts in the area varied when I asked whether it would be appropriate to sell MYCIN cassettes to doctors wanting to put it on their micro-computers.
p1870
aVSome said it would be ok if there were a means of keeping MYCIN's database current with new discoveries in the field, i.e.
p1871
aVwith new tests, new theories, new diagnoses and new antibiotics.
p1872
aVFor example, MYCIN would have to be told about Legionnaire's disease and the associated Legionnella bacteria\u000awhich became understood only after MYCIN was finished.
p1873
aV(MYCIN is very stubborn about new bacteria, and simply replies "unrecognized response".
p1874
aVOthers say that MYCIN is not even close to usable except experimentally, because it doesn't know its own limitations.
p1875
aVI suppose this is partly a question of whether the doctor using MYCIN is trusted to understand the documentation about its limitations.
p1876
aVProgrammers always develop the idea that the users of their programs are idiots, so the opinion that doctors aren't smart enough not to be misled by MYCIN's limitations may be at least partly a consequence of this ideology.
p1877
aVAn example of MYCIN not knowing its limitations can be excited by telling MYCIN that the patient has Cholerae Vibrio in his intestines.
p1878
aVMYCIN will cheerfully recommend two weeks of tetracycline and nothing else.
p1879
aVPresumably this would indeed kill the bacteria, but most likely the patient will be dead of cholera long before that.
p1880
aVHowever, the physician will presumably know that the diarrhea has to be treated and look elsewhere for how to do it.
p1881
aVOn the other hand it may be really true that some measure of common sense is required for usefulness even in this narrow domain.
p1882
aVWe'll list some areas of common sense knowledge and reasoning ability and also apply the criteria to MYCIN and other hypothetical programs operating in MYCIN's domain.

p1888
aVWith data correlated over many dimensions and millions of points, none of the old steps -- do experiment, record results, analyse and publish -- is straightforward.

p1894
aVas computers become essential parts of scientific instruments;
p1895
aVExperiments are themselves becoming electronic
p1896
aVboth Matlab and GenBankwill change enormously in that time.
p1897
aVFully documenting these steps would be arduous, and there is little chance that someone could repeat the exact procedure 20 years from now;
p1898
aVAs experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex,
p1899
aVdata become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.
p1900
aVas there are so many variables.
p1901
aVOne might argue that complex biological experiments have always been difficult to reproduce,
p1902
aVIncreasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.
p1903
aVThere are collaborations sharing data across departments and time zones, and important discoveries are made by scientists and teams who combine different skill sets -- not just biologists, physicists and chemists, but also computer scientists, statisticia
p1904
aVIt is important to realize that today's graduate students need formal training in areas beyond their central discipline:
p1905
aVthey need to know some data management, computational concepts and statistical techniques.
p1906
aVToo much effort is wasted on converting from one proprietary data format to another.
p1907
aVA collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.
p1908
aVin formatting,
p1909
aVso that data written by one group can be easily read and understood by others;
p1910
aVin semantics,
p1911
aVso that a term used by one group can be translated (often automatically) by another without its meaning being distorted;
p1912
aVand in workflows,
p1913
aVso that analysis steps can be executed across the Internet and reproduced by others at a later date.
p1914
aVFor these data to be useful to others,
p1915
aVthey must be published using a controlled vocabulary and instandard forms, and the instruments and measurements must be well specified.
p1916
aVThe speed of the Internet has not kept pace with the growth of scientific datasets.
p1917
aVAnd so large data archives are becoming increasingly 'isolated' in the network sense -- one can copy gigabytes across the Internet today, but not petabytes.
p1918
aVAre we reaching the limits of what one scientist, or one lab, can expect to achieve in data handling and analysis?
p1919
aVIf so, this will have implications for how we review and publish our work.
p1920
aVFor example, a data-mining paper needs to include the explicit description (data-base query) of how the data that were analysed in the paper were collected and filtered, but not the data themselves.
p1921
aVIn this way, a reviewer with access to public data could reproduce the data sets and analysis procedures.
p1922
aVFor the analysis to be repeatable in 20 years' time
p1923
aVrequires archiving both data and tools.
p1924
aVAstronomers created the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (www.IVOA.net), integrating most of the world's medium and large astronomy archives.
p1925
aVThis required new standards for data exchange, and a semantic dictionary that offers a controlled vocabulary of astronomy terms.
p1926
aVTo encourage data sharing,
p1927
aVit should be rewarded.
p1928
aVLikely computer-performance improvements by 2011 include tenfold more processing, storage and network bandwidth per dollar.
p1929
aVSo we can expect tentimes more data.
p1930
aVExponential growth occurs when a new generation of instruments leapfrogs the previous generation, which become obsolete.
p1931
aVThere are two trends in science today, scaling up and scaling out.
p1932
aVSome scientists are building billion-dollar facilities, such as astronomy's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope or the Large Hadron Collider, which are only affordable as international collaborations.
p1933
aVSuch facilities are not easily leapfrogged.
p1934
aVAnd once these peta-scale experiments are switched on they will produce roughly the same amount of data each year -- merely linear growth.
p1935
aVBut in the scaling-out model, experiments that deploy an array of small instruments can exploit the coming explosion in cheaper commodity technology.
p1936
aVAnd so although some subdisciplines may reach a plateau in data generation, other technological innovations will take their place.
p1937
aVScientists in 2020 will continue to work in an exponential world.

VSince these new instruments have extraordinary precision,
p1994
aVthe data quality is also rapidly improving.
p1995
aVAnalyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies
p1996
aVrequires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects -- finding both needles in the haystack and finding very small haystacks that were undetected in previous measurements.
p1997
aVWe believe that most new science happens when the data is examined in new ways.
p1998
aVSo our focus here is on data exploration, interactive data analysis, and integration of Level 2 datasets.
p1999
aVone could focus on the science rather than needing to be an information-technology-professional with expertise in arcane computer data analysis tools.
p2000
aVThings were simpler then;
p2001
aVThis is a consequence of three phenomena:
p2002
aV(1) More sophisticated algorithms consume more instructions to analyze each byte.
p2003
aV(2) Many analysis algorithms are super-linear, often needing N2 or N3 time to process N data points.
p2004
aVAnd (3) IO bandwidth has not kept pace with storage capacity.
p2005
aVThe demand for tools and computational resources to perform scientific data-analysis is rising even faster than data volumes.
p2006
aVTo ameliorate these problems,
p2007
aVscientists will need better analysis algorithms that can handle extremely large datasets with approximate algorithms (ones with near-linear execution time) and they will need parallel algorithms that can apply many processors and many disks to the problem to meet cpu-density and bandwidth-density demands.
p2008
aVIncreasingly, the datasets are so large, and the application programs are so complex,
p2009
aVthat it is much more economical to move the end-user's programs to the data and only communicate questions and answers rather than moving the source data and its applications to the user's local system.
p2010
aVThe new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.
p2011
aVIndeed, there is an emerging trend to store a personal workspace (a MyDB) at the data center and deposit answers there.
p2012
aVThis minimizes data movement and allows collaboration among a group of scientists doing joint analysis.
p2013
aVThese personal workspaces are also a vehicle for data analysis groups to collaborate.
p2014
aVbecause it will save them having to manage local data and computer farms.
p2015
aVMany scientists will prefer doing much of their analysis at data centers
p2016
aVWhen a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers,
p2017
aVthen there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.
p2018
aVIf this is common,
p2019
aVthe two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.
p2020
aVsince the data traffic will justify making the copy.
p2021
aVthe two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup
p2022
aVPeta-scale data sets will require 1000-10,000 disks and thousands of compute nodes.
p2023
aVAt any one time some of the disks and some of the nodes will be broken.
p2024
aVSuch systems have to have a mechanism in place to protect against data loss, and provide availability even with a less than full configuration -- a self-healing system is required.
p2025
aVData must be self-describing
p2026
aVin order to allow this.
p2027
aVThis self-description, or metadata, is central to all these scenarios;
p2028
aVit enables generic tools to understand the data, and it enables people to understand the data.
p2029
aVIf the data is to be analyzed by generic tools,
p2030
aVthe tools need to "understand" the data.
p2031
aVIf scientists are to read data collected by others,
p2032
aVthen the data must be carefully documented and must be published in forms that allow easy access and automated manipulation.
p2033
aVIdeally much of this metadata would be automatically generated and managed as part of the workflow,
p2034
aVreducing the scientist's intellectual burden.
p2035
aVIn the next decade, as data interchange among scientific disciplines becomes increasingly important,
p2036
aVa common HDF-like format and package for all the sciences will likely emerge.
p2037
aVsince an agreement on these concepts can help guide analysis tool designs.
p2038
aVThis will greatly facilitate tool-building and tools
p2039
aVThe separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.
p2040
aVSo, it is paradoxical that the data management community has worked for 40 years to achieve something called data independence -- a clear separation of programs from data.
p2041
aVWhile a database system might choose to map each row to a contiguous storage container (e.g.a record) on a single disk page, it might also choose to store large, possibly infrequently referenced attributes of a table corresponding to large text objects, JPEG images, or multidimensional arrays in separate storage containers on different disk pages and/or different storage volumes

aVthe database administrator can then define a view over T' and T" corresponding to the original definition of table T, allowing old programs to continue to operate correctly.
p2051
aVby dynamically translating data to the appropriate formats (converting among character and number representations, converting among 6-digit and 9-digit postal codes, converting between long-and-short names, and hiding new information from old programs.
p2052
aVViews are used to solve these problems
p2053
aVData classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.
p2054
aVSo, these ideas are still evolving.
p2055
aVby searching all the relevant files -- opening each file, extracting the relevant data and then moving onto the next file.
p2056
aVIn this model, data analysis proceeds

aVdata analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.
p2059
aVAs file systems grow to petabyte-scale archives with billions of files,
p2060
aVthe science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.
p2061
aVanalysis will be applied to "all data with these attributes" rather than working on a list of file/directory names or name patterns.
p2062
aVSet-oriented file processing will make file names increasingly irrelevant --
p2063
aV(they are just containers for data.
p2064
aVIndeed, the files themselves may become irrelevant
p2065
aVThey routinely allow the data to be replicated
p2066
aVso that it can be organized in several ways (by time, by space, by other attributes).
p2067
aVAll these tools are aimed at making it easy to analyze commercial data, but they are equally applicable to scientific data analysis.

aVIn addition, data analysis using data cubes has made huge advances, and now efforts are focused on integrating machine learning algorithms that infer trends, do data clustering, and detect anomalies.
p2069
aVfor analyzing objects (galaxies, spectra, proteins, events, etc.
p2070
aVConventional tabular database systems are adequate
p2071
aVThis collection of problems is generally called the impedance mismatch -- meaning the mismatch between the programming model and the database capabilities.
p2072
aVThe impedance mismatch has made it difficult to map many science applications into conventional tabular database systems.
p2073
aVThey are being integrated with programming languages
p2074
aVso that they can support object-oriented databases.
p2075
aVusing the same techniques they use on native types.
p2076
aVQueries can read and write these extended types
p2077
aVOnce you can put your types and your programs inside the database
p2078
aVyou get the parallelism, non-procedural query, and data independence advantages of traditional database systems.
p2079
aVThey have a schema language (metadata) to define the metadata.
p2080
aVThey have a few indexing strategies, and a simple data manipulation language.
p2081
aVThey have the start of non-procedural and parallel programming.
p2082
aVAnd, they have a collection of tools to create, access, search, and visualize the data.
p2083
aVSo, in our view they are simple database systems.
p2084
aVIf one takes the controversial view that HDF, NetCDF, FITS, and Root are nascent database systems that provide metadata and portability but lack non-procedural query analysis, automatic parallelism, and sophisticated indexing,
p2085
aVthen one can see a fairly clear path that integrates these communities.
p2086
aVWhy are tabular databases so successful in commercial applications and such a flop in most scientific applications?
p2087
aVScientific colleagues give one or more of the following answers when asked why they do not use databases to manage their data:
p2088
aV1)	We don't see any benefit in them.
p2089
aVThe cost of learning the tools (data definition and data loading, and query) doesn't seem worth it.
p2090
aV2)	They do not offer good visualization/plotting tools.
p2091
aV3)	I can handle my data volumes with my programming language.
p2092
aV4)	They do not support our data types (arrays, spatial, text, etc.
p2093
aV.
p2094
aV5)	They do not support our access patterns (spatial, temporal, etc.
p2095
ag2094
aV6)	We tried them but they were too slow.
p2096
aV7)	We tried them but once we loaded our data we could no longer manipulate the data using our standard application programs.
p2097
aV8)	They require an expensive guru (database administrator) to use.
p2098
aVby reading and writing the database.
p2099
aVThe database approach has the added benefit that visualization tools can watch and steer the computation
p2100
aVBecause data collection is now separated from data analysis,
p2101
aVextensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.
p2102
aVfor data sharing among different disciplines and for data analysis and visualization tools.
p2103
aVGood metadata becomes central
p2104
aVWe believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages
p2105
aVso that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.
p2106
aVBecause data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace,

aVmoving code to data will be essential to performance.

VScience centers that curate and serve science data are emerging around next-generation science instruments.
p2208
aVThe world-wide telescope, GenBank, and the BaBar collaborations are prototypes of this trend.
p2209
aVOne group of scientists is collecting the data and managing these archives.
p2210
aVA larger group of scientists are exploring these archives the way previous generations explored their private data.
p2211
aVOften the results of the analysis are fed back to the archive to add to the corpus.
p2212
aVBecause data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.
p2213
aVGood metadata becomes central for data sharing among different disciplines and for data analysis and visualization tools.
p2214
aVThere is a convergence of the nascent-databases (HDF, NetCDF, FITS, ...
p2215
aVwhich focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets.
p2216
aVThe traditional systems have the virtues of automatic parallelism, indexing, and non-procedural access, but they need to embrace the data types of the science community and need to co-exist with data in file systems.
p2217
aVWe believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.
p2218
aVThree technical advances will be crucial to scientific analysis:
p2219
aV(1) extensive metadata and metadata standards that will make it easy to discover what data exists, make it easy for people and programs to understand the data, and make it easy to track data lineage;
p2220
aV(2) great analysis tools that allow scientists to easily ask questions, and to easily understand and visualize the answers;
p2221
aVand (3) set-oriented data parallelism access supported by new indexing schemes and new algorithms that allow us to interactively explore peta-scale datasets.
p2222
aVThe goal is a smart notebook that empowers scientists to explore the world's data.
p2223
aVScience data centers with computational resources to explore huge data archives will be central to enabling such notebooks.
p2224
aVBecause data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.
p2225
aVConsequently, science centers will remain the core vehicle and federations will likely be secondary.
p2226
aVScience centers will provide both the archives and the institutional infrastructure to develop these peta-scale archives and the algorithms and tools to analyze them.

VGiven several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.
p2233
aVA typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.
p2234
aVif they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.
p2235
aVTwo objects are said to match
p2236
aVIf only stationary objects are to be matched,
p2237
aVthen the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.
p2238
aVThe observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.
p2239
aVThese convolutions will broaden the Dirac delta.
p2240
aVIn those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error,
p2241
aVand therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.
p2242
aVIf the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center,
p2243
aVit would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.
p2244
aVby limiting their search space.
p2245
aVHaving a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly
p2246
aVGiven two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2,
p2247
aVwe call the pair an O1-run2 hit.
p2248
aVIf there are no O1-run2 hits,
p2249
aVwe call it an O1-run2 miss.
p2250
aVEphemeral:
p2251
aVO1 is at the detection threshold and the seeing was good in run1 but not as good in run2 or O1 may be invisible if run2 is a different kind of instrument (e.g.
p2252
aVrun1 is optical and run2 is radio or Xray), or O1 is a variable or transient object which varied below the detection threshold in run2, or O1 moved more than the classification distance between the two observations.
p2253
aVMasked:
p2254
aVO1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.
p2255
aVEdge:
p2256
aVO1 was on the edge of the run2 footprint and so not all its pixels were observed.
p2257
aVO1-run2 misses can have three generic causes (see Figure 1):
p2258
aVO1 was on the edge of the run2 footprint and
p2259
aVso not all its pixels were observed.
p2260
aVbecause the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips,
p2261
aVabout 5% are edge objects.
p2262
aVbecause it does not radiate in that spectral band, or the two instruments may have very different sensitivity.
p2263
aVthe object may not be visible in the second instrument
p2264
aVWhen the objectID1-run2 pair is a miss, then objectID2 is zero,
p2265
aVand the hitOrMiss flag suggests why (Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge)
p2266
aVas the Neighbors table using the Zones algorithm described in [2].
p2267
aVIndeed, the SDSS catalog pre-computes the spatial join
p2268
aVIndeed, the SDSS catalog pre-computes the spatial join as the Neighbors table using the Zones algorithm described in [2].
p2269
aVSo the hit query is even simpler -- one just looks for neighbors within 1" with run1 \u005cneq run2 since Neighbors stores all object pairs within 30".
p2270
aVsince Neighbors stores all object pairs within 30".
p2271
aVone just looks for neighbors within 1" with run1 \u005cneq run2
p2272
aVThis representation dovetails with the HTM library [1]
p2273
aVthat makes it easy to find all points within a region.
p2274
aVIf this is an inexpensive test and if there are less than a thousand runs,
p2275
aVthen one can compute the overlapping run pairs by simply comparing all runs to all others.
p2276
aVThe residual misses are neither edge nor masked
p2277
aVso they must be ephemeral.
p2278
aVThis might be caused by the object moving, or it might just be an unusually large position error, or they might just be different objects.
p2279
aVFor example, in Figure 2 object O1 matches O2 and O2 matches O3 but object O1 may not match O3.
p2280
aVHaving the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...
p2281
aVabout the object's position, magnitude, classification, the number and types of misses that the object experienced, and other attributes.
p2282
aVThis suggests creating a Bundle table that records these statistics.
p2283
aVif the new record causes one bundle to overlap another.
p2284
aVOne complication is that adding records may cause bundles to merge
p2285
aVonce each match record has an assigned bundle ID.
p2286
aVIt is easy to compute the aggregate statistics for the bundle table
p2287
aVComputing the bundle IDs is a bit tricky
p2288
aVso that code is included here.
p2289
aVbecause the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.
p2290
aVOf the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge
p2291
aVMost objects are slow-moving
p2292
aVso their displacement between observations is small compared to the average inter-object difference.
p2293
aVNear-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and
p2294
aVso measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.
p2295
aVFor faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and
p2296
aVso the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.
p2297
aVWhen considering SDSS observations separated by days or years,
p2298
aVonly very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.
p2299
aVGiven this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center),
p2300
aVthe techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.
p2301
aVby using a larger classification distance.
p2302
aVthe techniques described here can find slowly moving objects
p2303
aVBut if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher,
p2304
aVthen the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.
p2305
aVIf there are no matches in a catalog
p2306
aVthen that field is filled in with the relational null value.
p2307
aVbecause this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.
p2308
aVWe call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match)
p2309
aVGiven the bundle and match tables,
p2310
aVthe pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs, as follows:
