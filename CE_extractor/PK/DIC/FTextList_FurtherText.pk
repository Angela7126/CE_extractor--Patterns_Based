p30
aS'(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.'
p31
aS'These characteristics lead to the following principles:'
p32
aS'(3) Representation and its summarization are separated.'
p33
aS"This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding."
p34
aS'The above separation principles lead to the natural obstacle of summarization.'
p35
aS'The above principle means that even people sharing the represented knowledge may not be the suitable person for summarizing the representation because they may not have the knowledge of representation.'
p36
aS'(1) Authors who commonly cited a representation are the candidates of suitable summarizers.'
p37
aS'This is because the represented knowledge was shared and the knowledge for representation is at the same level.'
p38
aS'(2) Authors are the best persons to summarize their own representations.'
p39
aS'This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.'
p40
aS'Different persons can make different summaries for the same text, and one person can generate different summaries for the same text at different times.'

p51
aS'A good summarizer should know its potential readers.'
p52
aS"This requests a summarizer to collect and analyze readers' interests according to their reading behaviors and attitudes to summaries."
p53
aS'Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.'
p54
aS'Therefore, it is necessary to understand citation when studying summarization.'
p55
aS'A research area emerges and evolves through continual citing a set of papers on the same set of concepts through time.'
p56
aS'As shown in Figure 3, a new paper A (denoting the title, author, abstract, etc.) becomes an often-cited paper and then becomes a source paper when the area is gradually formed.'
p57
aS'A survey paper summarizes an area through citing many papers in the area, and it is often cited as it helps later researchers to quickly know this area.'
p58
aS'It is feasible to transform a citation network into a text by using some language patterns (for example, "the idea of A was extended by B", "the idea of A was used by B", and "the idea of A inspired B") to represent different citations, main roles, relations, and development track.'
p59
aS'Different from scientific papers, webpages can be changed, and links can be also changed, so the hyperlink network of webpages evolve notably.'
p60
ag60
aS'Some implicit citations have mark words such as "someone says" and according to "someone\'s opinion".'
p61
aS'These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.'
p62
aS'Citation is an individual selection of relevant representations for explaining, evidencing, complementing, commenting, or revising a representation, either explicitly or implicitly, according to individual motivation and knowledge.'
p63
ag63
aS'If representation A cites a set of representations B, then B constitutes an extension of A.'
p64
aS'If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.'
p65
aS'In scientific papers, the core representations usually appear in the front and in the end (e.g., title, abstract and conclusion) so that readers can be impressed before and after reading the main body.'
p66
aS'This helps enhance the memory of the core by focusing and refocusing on the core when building or retrieving the semantic images in the mental space.'
p67
aS'Humans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times, so we have the following axiom.'
p68
aS'This axiom is the basis of representation (including using languages) and summarization (especially, for multi-document summarization).'
p69
aS'Therefore, a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations:'
p70
aS'Dictionaries explain words in texts, so they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts.'
p71
aS'From this point of view, any text has a set of basic citations.'
p72
aS'So, the above statement is suitable for text.'
p73
aS'The basic behaviors of summarization include emerging, selecting, citing (explicitly or implicitly), and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.'
p74
aS'Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.'
p75
aS'Structuring summary in an appropriate form is important as summary is mainly for human to read and understand.'
p76
aS'An appropriate form concerns the innovative cyber display based on human mental structure, psychological structure and innovative display.'
p77
aS'The following are some dimensions for organizing a summary.'
p78
aS'The original structure of the core representations takes the priority to appear in summary.'
p79
aS'The reason is that authors are the best person to organize his representation.'
p80
aS'Sub-dimensions can be arranged according to the measure of relevance between coordinates.'
p81
aS'Figure 5 shows a three-dimensional space for organizing representations through time dimension, author dimension and topic dimension.'
p82
aS'The personal spaces reflect personal reading experience, interests and knowledge based on the texts that have been read.'
p83
aS'The summarization system is responsible for classifying, linking and reorganizing representations.'
p84
aS"The function 'Classifying & Linking' classifies representations according to the given dimensions, connects representations by discovering implicit relations, transforming implicit relations into explicit relations, discovering communities, and identifying appropriate representations."
p85
aS'Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.'
p86
aS'A summary can be in form of a hypertext, where some texts are summarized as a hyperlink, and some texts containing hyperlinks are summarized as a hyperlink at the higher level.'
p87
aS'The advantage is that the content is the same as the original text and readers can read the concise top-level content first and then read the details by clicking the link if they are interested in.'
p88
aS'(b) Rank the paragraphs of the text according to the interest.'
p89
aS'Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.'
p90
aS'Coordinating texts, pictures and videos can render a summary from different channels of sense.'
p91
aS'It is particularly useful in making slides or posters for scientific research according to papers, and summarizing historical and literature works.'
p92
aS'Summarization is involved in individual and social construction processes, so it concerns multiple dimensions.'
p93
aS'The basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding indicate the following dimensions for evaluating a summarization:'
p94
aS"A summary should match the reader's cognitive level."
p95
aS"Therefore, concepts at the reader's cognitive level should be selected."
p96
aS'A summarizer can understand the input representation better if it knows more about the author, including the relevant articles and social networks.'
p97
aS'Input should also be evaluated because some representations are unnecessary for summarization.'
p98
aS'The closed systems designed by particular persons are unable to make satisfied summarization because only the persons sharing knowledge with the writer can make satisfied summarization.'
p99
aS'This also implies that a summarizer should be able to interact with readers so that it can select the appropriate representations (e.g., sentences) and use the representations that the reader is familiar with.'
p100
aS'It is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.'
p101
aS'Many applications have incorporated pictures into summaries, e.g., transforming a paper into slides or a poster, transforming a novel into a carton book, and creating a webpage according to a set of texts and pictures.'
p102
aS'There could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected according to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences according to the semantic locality principle [Zhuge, 2010].'
p103
ag103
aS'A picture can convey meaning in about 1-10 seconds due to its familiarity and complexity to the viewer.'
p104
aS"The summary incorporating pictures can enhance reader's short-term and long-term memory."
p105
aS'An explanation is that the summary with pictures gives readers stronger impression and provides more dimensions for rendering meaning, and establishes more links to render meaning.'
p106
aS'Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.'
p107
aS'The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.'
p108
ag108
ag108
aS'So building the networks is the key to solve the problem.'
p109
aS'Language representations like tags indicate the usage of the pictures.'
p110
aS'a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.'
p111
aS'd) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.'
p112
aS'The strategy is to make use of sensors and create semantic links between pictures and texts by detecting common projections at physical and social dimensions.'
p113
aS'Research can lead to a new form of summary that can increase readability and understandability.'
p114
aS'Online picture-sharing systems like Flicker provide rich picture resources for implementing this idea.'
p115
ag115
aS'As new pictures are continually added to the online systems, a good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.'
p116
aS'The core words such as "CIKM2012", "hotel", "golf" and "garden" can be identified by comparing the source text and tags.'
p117
aS'Then, the relations like "back of" relying on the core words can be identified.'
p118
aS'So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].'
p119
aS'Different from image retrieval (e.g., search images according to keywords), the picture-based summarization approach has a ground of texts (a network of source texts or summaries) when searching the picture-text repository.'
p120
aS'The generated summary is not unique as the tag sets of different pictures may be overlapped.'
p121
aS'According to the efficiency principle and regional principle, the radius of the network should be small.'
p122
aS'In real application, a summarization system should enable readers to adjust the radius according to requirement.'
p123
aS'Different classes of people play different roles in society and thus are likely involved in different events.'
p124
aS'Humans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements, but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday.'
p125
aS'For particular applications like football games [Ekin, 2003], important sections such as slow-motion segments and goals in game are known by humans, so it is easy to find the important sections.'
p126
aS'Modern movies provide more channels (e.g., voice and music) for understanding than early silent movies.'
p127
aS'Current online movies contain subtitles, which provide a new condition for making summarization of videos through natural language processing.'
p128
aS'These subtitles provide the basis for generating a piece of text as the summary of movies.'
p129
aS'A semantics-based approach to summarizing videos is to construct a semantic structure on videos by introducing semantic links into videos.'
p130
aS'A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.'
p131
aS'Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].'
p132
aS'Making abstraction on graph components can be done through mathematical derivation.'
p133
aS'So, summarization in these areas has the reasons of summarization and the correctness guarantee of using summaries.'
p134
aS'If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.'
p135
aS'The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.'
p136
aS'There have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures with the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years due to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones.'
p137
aS'Humans can make a humanized summarization because they have experience and knowledge out of pictures.'
p138
aS'Select the representative tags of these pictures, search relevant texts according to these tags (or select the texts that contain or link to these pictures), and then summarize these texts.'
p139
aS'Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.'
p140
ag140
aS'(4) Generating a small network of texts according to a large set of pictures.'
p141
aS'A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.'
p142
aS'The key problem is to select a better picture from the candidates that have the same projections on the dimensions of time, location and topic, because the semantic links between pictures may be poor.'
p143
aS'Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:'
p144
aS'A distinguished characteristic is that humans generate behaviors (including mental behaviors) different from the input.'
p145
aS'This indicates that human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level.'
p146
ag146
aS'This indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts, pictures, videos and graphs.'
p147
aS'Cognitive psychologists argue that people usually remember meaning rather than exact representation and that meaning represents through the perceptual and motor systems for interacting with the world.'
p148
aS'Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.'
p149
aS'However, unifying different theories is hard because it needs to uncover the common nature behind existing theories, and different theories may represent different aspects of a domain and use different representation systems that are difficult to be unified.'
p150
aS'Knowledge representation approaches such as the production rule [Davis, et al, 1977], the frame [Minsky, 1975] and the semantic net [Quillian, 1966] are symbol systems that can carry out reasoning for solving problems.'
p151
aS'A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.'
p152
aS'From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.'
p153
ag153
aS'Therefore, we have the following definition.'
p154
aS'The scale of summary can be regarded as a dimension.'
p155
aS"The reason is that a reader can easily and quickly understand the summary if the dimension of the target space is the same as the dimension of the reader's personal space, which represents the reader's mind (cognitive architecture)."
p156
aS'The definition of summarization based on citation given in section 4 gives the range of T, and (di, ..., dj) reflects the basic cognitive level of reader.'
p157
aS"A summary is suitable if its cognitive level is the same as the reader's cognitive level."
p158
aS"(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation."
p159
aS"(2) If the cognitive level of the original representation is higher than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy."
p160
aS"(3) If the cognitive level of the original representation is lower than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more general concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy."
p161
aS'Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.'
p162
aS'This enables summarization systems to use more general or specific concepts in summary.'
p163
aS'It is important to ensure the understandability and expressiveness of the integrated representation.'
p164
aS'As a kind of union, data integration enables users to get a global view of data generated from different sources [Friedman, et al, 1999;'
p165
aS'Different representations of the same thing can be linked to the same semantic image for understanding and thinking [Zhuge, 2010, 2011, 2012].'

aS'The following experiments evaluate the recall and precision for querying the resource spaces of the two models.'
p1056
aS'According to the probability upper bound, the papers are classified into eight categories:'
p1057
aS'This is due to the fact that it is easier to misjudge when the probabilities that a paper belongs to several topics are almost equal.'
p1058
aS'It is mainly because a paper can belong to several topics in the 1NF resource space whereas a paper can belong to only one topic in the \n2NF resource space.'
p1059
aS'It is mainly because the probabilistic resource space can store all the probabilistic information that a paper belongs to several topics regardless of their independence.'

aS'10 indicates the trend in the recall and the precision of the probabilistic resource space PRS1 with the increase of confidence threshold.'
p1061
aS'When querying the probabilistic resource space, only the papers for which the membership probability is equal to or larger than the confidence threshold can be returned.'
p1062
aS'Thus, the number of returned relevant papers goes down and the total number of the returned papers goes down more.'
p1063
aS'This is because if the confidence threshold is 0, all the papers probably belonging to a topic will be returned.'
p1064

p1065
aS'(2) Normal forms have more impact on resource distribution in the resource spaces than the distribution in the probabilistic resource spaces.'

aS'This is because a resource in the probabilistic resource space can be inserted into a point if its membership probability belonging to this point is larger than 0.'
p1067

aS'This dynamic nature brings many interesting research issues.'
p1141
aS'Semantic Web is mainly based on ontology mechanisms and markup languages such as XML (www.w3.org/XML) and RDF [13].'
p1142
aS'RDF (www.w3.org/RDF) describes the universal resources and their relationships based on the triple (object, attribute, value).'
p1143
aS'Based on RDF and XML, OWL (www.w3.org/2004/OWL/) uses ontology to describe the semantics of resources and uses roles to describe their relationships [14].'
p1144
aS'The evolution of ontology is based on the basic atomic changes, and basic additions to or deletions from an RDF graph, which can be aggregated to compound changes [16].'
p1145
aS'The initial motivation of the semantic link network SLN was to extend the hyperlink networks by enriching links and inclusion of rules and rule reasoning [2, 3, 6, 20\xe2\x80\x9323].'
p1146
aS'Previous semantic net, semantic web, hyperlink, and semantic link are too static to represent dynamic relations in nature, minds, and society.'
p1147
aS'Hence, SLN was extended to Socio-Natural Thought SLN for semantic networking in CP-Society [5].'
p1148
aS'If there are two semantic links sharing a common node and satisfying a reasoning rule, then a relational reasoning can be conducted, e.g.'
p1149
aS'd1 -e1-> d2, d2 -e2-> d3 => d1 -e3-> d3 according to the \xef\xac\x81rst rule in S, and one semantic link can imply the other link, i.e.'
p1150
ag1150
aS'd1 -e6-> d2 => d1 -e7-> d2 according to the third rule in S.'
p1151
aS'A CPSocio-SLN M is the minimum semantic cover of another CPSocio-SLN S, if it satis\xef\xac\x81es the following conditions:'
p1152
aS'{{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e7}}, {{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e8}}, {{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e9}}, {{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e10}}, {{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e11}}, and {{e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} U {e12}};'
p1153
aS'hence the minimum semantic cover for a CPSocio-SLN is not unique.'
p1154
aS'The minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN is not unique, but the importance of different minimum semantic covers is different.'
p1155
aS'Hence, we can select the most important one and regard it as the representative.'
p1156
aS'Adding e7, the CPSocio-SLN obtains semantic links {e8, e9, e10, e11, e12}.'
p1157
ag1157
aS'Hence, e7 should be in the important minimum semantic cover.'
p1158
aS'Actually, Figure 2 implies a reasoning circulation.'
p1159
aS"Change M to M' by adding e to M, and calculate the semantic closure."
p1160
aS'If adding any semantic link to the set will lead to the same effect, the link set is called equivalent link set.'
p1161
aS'A reasoning circulation can also be found by checking the log of CPSocio-SLN system.'
p1162
aS'We can see that the cause of Theorem 1 is the existence of the equivalent semantic link set, because adding any link to this set leads to the same effect.'
p1163
ag1163
aS'CPSocio-SLN should handle the reasoning process if it has found a reasoning circulation.'
p1164
aS'Given a CPSocio-SLN G1 = Gmin\xe2\x88\x92{e, a}, if the closure of G1 does not include a and the closure of G1 U {e} include a, we say that e determines a (or a is determined by e).'

p1170
aS'The basic operations (2) and (4) are for transforming semantic links.'
p1171
aS'The basic operations (5) and (6) are for transforming rules.'
p1172
aS'Second, any pair of operations in the set is orthogonal, since no one can be represented by the other in this operation set.'
p1173
aS'The following algorithm is for calculating the semantic closure of a given CPSocio-SLN:'
p1174
aS'(3) If Q is not empty, go to step 2, else the algorithm ends.'
p1175
aS'Based on the determination relation among semantic links, the following theorem can be reached.'
p1176
aS'If e is not in the minimum semantic cover, then G1 is equal to G1 U {e}.'
p1177
aS'According to De\xef\xac\x81nition 2, it is impossible that G1 does not include a and G1 U {e} includes a.'
p1178
ag1178
aS'Hence, e does not determine a.'
p1179
aS'Since the semantic link a is anyone, there is no semantic link determined by e.'
p1180
aS'The conclusion is inconsistent with the assumption.'
p1181
aS'Hence, the theorem holds.'
p1182
aS'If the semantic link to be deleted is not in the minimum semantic cover, the CPSocio-SLN equals to the original CPSocio-SLN after operating DelLink on it.'
p1183
aS'If the semantic link to be added is in the closure of the CPSocio-SLN, the CPSocio-SLN equals to the original CPSocio-SLN after operating AddLink on it.'
p1184
aS'Deleting a semantic link between two semantic nodes and then adding it between the same pair of nodes, this CPSocio-SLN is unchanged.'
p1185
aS'However, if we change the order of operations, the result will be different.'
p1186
aS'Adding a semantic link between two nodes and then deleting it, the minimum semantic cover of the CPSocio-SLN may be changed.'
p1187
aS'Based on the basic operation 3, if we delete e3, e2 should be deleted too.'
p1188
aS'Compared with the original minimum semantic cover, the CPSocio-SLN has been changed because of missing e2.'
p1189
aS'Characteristic 5 can be easily obtained from characteristic 4.'
p1190
aS'Adding a semantic link between two nodes and then deleting it between the same pair of nodes, the CPSocio-SLN may be changed.'
p1191
ag1191
aS'Hence, after adding (deleting) a semantic link, we cannot simply use the deleting (adding) operation to recover the CPSocio-SLN.'
p1192
aS"Figure 4 shows the semantic link m that can reason out a can be reasoned out by a, because a's determining set includes m."
p1193
aS'If we delete a, then the semantic links that are determined by a will not be reasoned out.'
p1194
aS'This characteristic implies that its determining set should not be deleted after deleting a semantic link, because there may be another determining set that has intersection with it.'
p1195
aS'For example, semantic link consanguinity implies that the predecessor and successor of this link must have attribute life-form.'
p1196
aS'Hence, the inter-resource semantic link can help resources \xef\xac\x81nd the attributes they do not know before.'
p1197
aS'The evolution of semantic link network is based on inter-resource semantic links.'
p1198
aS'The execution of operations is related to the storage of CPSocio-SLN.'

p1201
aS'This strategy leads to high ef\xef\xac\x81ciency in query, but the cost of maintenance is also high.'

aS'(2) Save the minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN.'
p1204
aS'This strategy leads to high ef\xef\xac\x81ciency in maintenance, but the cost of query is high.'
p1205
aS'If we want to know a relation between two nodes, the reasoning cost is high.'
p1206
aS'The third ef\xef\xac\x81cient storage strategy is to save both the semantic closure and the minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN so that we can operate on the minimum semantic cover and can query on the closure.'
p1207
aS'(1) The semantic links to be queried must have been reasoned out.'
p1208
aS'As the closure of CPSocio- SLN is stored, we can \xef\xac\x81nd these links ef\xef\xac\x81ciently.'

aS"A semantic link's minimum spanning graph set is a graph set of these minimum spanning graphs."

aS'As shown in Figure 7, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e10, and e11 are the semantic links in the minimum semantic cover, other semantic links are derived.'
p1213
aS'If any semantic link in G has been deleted, G cannot reason out e any more.'
p1214
aS'If G still can reason out e after deleting semantic link a in the minimum spanning graph, the graph G-{the deleted link} is also a spanning graph of e and a proper subgraph of G.'
p1215
ag1215
aS'Hence, G is not the minimum spanning graph of e.'
p1216
aS'If a link is in the minimum spanning graph set, we add its rank by one.'
p1217
aS"After checking all links' minimum spanning graph set, we can get a link set, links in this set have the same rank and links that are not in the set have a smaller rank."

aS'(2) Find new links which should be added to CPSocio-SLN because of adding link e, and then add these new links to CPSocio-SLN.'
p1225
aS'Assuming semantic link e has n minimum spanning graphs, the minimum spanning graph set is Ce = {G1, G2 ...'

p1227
aS'Hence, all the semantic links in Gi (i = 1, 2, .'
p1228
aS'If users delete a semantic link ek in E, should e be deleted?'
p1229
aS'If Ce is empty, e should be deleted after deleting ek since e cannot be reasoned out by any part of the CPSocio-SLN.'
p1230
ag1230
aS'Hence, we should \xef\xac\x81nd a way to obtain the minimum spanning graph of every semantic link.'
p1231
aS'Every CPSocio-SLN has a conformation sequence.'
p1232
aS'That means every CPSocio-SLN can be obtained by adding nodes and semantic links orderly.'
p1233
ag1233
aS'Hence, what we need to do is updating the minimum spanning graph set of every link when we add a new link to CPSocio-SLN graph.'
p1234
aS"Based on Characteristic 4, adding a new link may change the other links' minimum spanning graph sets."
p1235
aS"If a CPSocio-SLN only has one semantic link, this link's minimum spanning graph set only has one minimum spanning graph which is this semantic link itself."

aS'If nodes in the minimum semantic cover are isolated, they are also isolated in closure, and vice versa.'

aS'(4) Maintenance for adding or deleting a rule AddRules The maintenance operation of adding or deleting a rule is to update the CPSocio-SLN according to new rule set by using step 3 in maintenance of the AddNode operation.'
p1243

aS'After deleting a semantic link e, the algorithm must check all of the other links if they have a minimum spanning graph that includes e;'

aS'The following algorithm is for deriving potential semantic links.'
p1588
aS'Meanwhile, the size of rule set rs is a constant.'

aS'So, the complexity of the above algorithm is O(1).'

aS'For a semantic link network with m resources and n semantic links, under the assumption of equal distribution, there are d = n/m(m\xe2\x88\x921) links between two resources on average.'
p1591
aS"Therefore, from R' to Rn, the number of paths with length k is Pm k\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x921 2dk."
p1592
aS'However, it can be reduced by reducing the scale of the semantic link network.'
p1593
aS'This algorithm is efficient because the up-closure for a semantic link type may be much smaller than the original link type set, and the projection may be sparse in light of semantic links.'
p1594
aS'However, the complexity would be much higher because both the start and the end resources need to compute.'
p1595
aS'Therefore, we get the following six RC-NF1 sub-schemas according to Algorithm 1.'
p1596
aS'Therefore, we get the following six RC-NF1 sub-schemas according to Algorithm 1.'
p1597
aS'Sub-schemas ^S4, ^S5 and ^S6 satisfy RC-NF2 because each has only one rule.'
p1598
aS'However, sub-schemas ^S1 and ^S2 are not in RC-NF2, so they need to be decomposed into RC-NF2 according to Algorithm 3.'
p1599
ag1599
aS'According to Theorems 2 and 3, the decomposition is loss-less.'
p1600
aS'Dividing a schema into several RC-NF2 sub-schemas can significantly reduce the scale so that the query and reasoning can be executed within a small scale.'
p1601
aS'In most cases, the decomposition to RC-NF2 is enough for the reason that a RC-NF2 schema is the smallest unit in the sense of reasoning closed.'
p1602
aS'According to Algorithm 4, we get a new decomposition by replacing the sub-schema ^S1.1 and ^S1.2 with the following three schemas ^S1.10, ^S1.20 and ^S1.40 and the semantic relative net is shown in Fig.'
p1603
ag1603
aS'We can also avoid the redundancy problem by modifying the schema ^S1.2 and building a conference to ^S1.1 directly rather than creating a new schema.'
p1604
aS'The following are two examples to show how to maintain the SLN schema while appending some rules to or removing some rules from the rule set according to Algorithms 6 and 7 respectively.'
p1605
aS'According to Algorithm 6, we can modify the sub-schemas as follows.'
p1606
aS'According to Algorithm 7, we find the sub-shcema ^S1.1 which involve in engageIn.'
p1607
aS'Then, we need to delete the semantic link type engageIn from the sub-schemas and the rules related with engageIn, i.e., rule 8, rule 14\xe2\x80\x9318 and rule 21, from the rule set.'
p1608
aS'Thus, we get a new semantic relative net as shown in Fig.'
p1609
aS'And the other sub-schemas such as ^S1.2, ^S1.3, ^S2.1, and ^S2.2 need not to be changed.'
